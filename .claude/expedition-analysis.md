# üìä EXPEDITION SYSTEM - DETAILED ANALYSIS REPORT

## Executive Summary

The expedition system has been **substantially migrated** from old implementation, but has **critical gaps** between spec and current code. The PA deduction logic exists but has **incomplete condition checking**. The resource consumption switching is implemented correctly.

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **PA Consumption Logic (PARTIAL - 80% DONE)**

**File:** `backend/src/cron/daily-pa.cron.ts` lines 178-268

**Working:**
- ‚úÖ STEP 5: PA regeneration with hunger penalties (lines 103-122)
- ‚úÖ STEP 6: Direction appending (lines 141-176)
- ‚úÖ STEP 7: PA deduction for DEPARTED expeditions (lines 178-268)
  - ‚úÖ Checks if expedition has `pendingEmergencyReturn` flag ‚Üí skip deduction
  - ‚úÖ Checks if character PA >= 2 ‚Üí deduct 2 PA
  - ‚úÖ Calls `removeMemberCatastrophic()` on failure
  - ‚úÖ Logging and counting

**Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Catastrophic return conditions are **INCOMPLETE**
  - Current check (line 238-242):
    ```typescript
    const shouldCatastrophicReturn =
      character.hungerLevel <= 1 ||     // ‚úì Affam√©/agonie
      character.isDead ||               // ‚úì Mort
      character.hp <= 1 ||              // ‚úì HP agonie
      character.pm <= 2;                // ‚úó WRONG (should be pm <= 0 for depression only)
    ```
  - Missing condition: No check for character stuck in PLANNING/LOCKED status

### 2. **Resource Location Switching (CORRECT)**

**File:** `backend/src/controllers/character/character-stats.controller.ts` lines 43-58

**Working:**
- ‚úÖ `eatFood()`: Checks if character in DEPARTED expedition ‚Üí eats from EXPEDITION stock
- ‚úÖ Otherwise ‚Üí eats from CITY stock
- ‚úÖ Applies to both `eatFood()` and `eatFoodAlternative()`
- ‚úÖ Follows spec exactly:
  - PLANNING/LOCKED: use CITY stock
  - DEPARTED: use EXPEDITION stock

### 3. **Emergency Return Logic (MOSTLY CORRECT)**

**File:** `backend/src/services/expedition.service.ts` lines 675-830

**Working:**
- ‚úÖ `toggleEmergencyVote()`: Creates/removes vote with threshold check
- ‚úÖ Sets `pendingEmergencyReturn = true` when threshold reached (50% + 1)
- ‚úÖ `forceEmergencyReturns()`: Processes returns marked as emergency
- ‚úÖ Updates expedition status to RETURNED

**Integration:**
- ‚úÖ PA deduction cron checks `pendingEmergencyReturn` flag
- ‚úÖ Skips PA deduction when flag is set
- ‚úì This prevents double-payment on return day

### 4. **Expedition Lifecycle (CORRECT)**

Cron execution order:
- ‚úÖ 00:00: Lock PLANNING expeditions
- ‚úÖ 08:00: Return DEPARTED expeditions (normal + emergency)
- ‚úÖ 08:00: Depart LOCKED expeditions

---

## ‚ùå CRITICAL GAPS

### Gap #1: Incomplete Catastrophic Return Conditions

**Spec requires:**
```
Remove if:
1. isDead = true
2. Health state: HP <= 1 (agonie/mort)
3. Hunger state: hungerLevel <= 1 (affam√©/agonie)
4. Mood state: PM = 0 (d√©pression) <- SPEC says ONLY depression, NOT d√©prime
5. ??? Any other state conditions?
```

**Current code (line 238-242):**
```typescript
const shouldCatastrophicReturn =
  character.hungerLevel <= 1 ||  // Correct: <= 1 is affam√©/agonie
  character.isDead ||            // Correct: isDead
  character.hp <= 1 ||           // Correct: hp agonie/mort
  character.pm <= 2;             // WRONG: includes PM=2,1 (d√©prime), should be PM=0 only
```

**Impact:** Characters with d√©prime (PM=2 or 1) are incorrectly removed

**Fix:** Change to `character.pm <= 0` OR split into separate check

---

### Gap #2: No Check for Character State During LOCKED Phase

**Spec says:**
```
√Ä minuit lorsque l'exp√©dition est LOCKED,
on doit [check si les membres peuvent continuer]
Si un character ne peut pas d√©penser ses deux PA...
il est automatiquement retir√© de l'exp√©dition
```

**Current code:**
- Only checks conditions during DEPARTED phase (line 185)
- No check during LOCKED ‚Üí DEPARTED transition
- No removal when locking if conditions not met

**Impact:** Members with bad state could lock into expedition they can't continue

**Fix:** Add character state check in `lockExpeditionsDue()` (expedition.cron.ts lines 8-49)

---

### Gap #3: Missing Log Message for Catastrophic Returns

**Spec requires:**
```
Un message de log public dans le channel de /config-channel-admin,
de type "**character** est rentr√© en catastrophe ! + tag admin"
```

**Current code (line 251):**
```typescript
await container.expeditionService.removeMemberCatastrophic(expedition.id, character.id, reason);
// Only logs via logger service, no public Discord message
```

**Check:** Does `removeMemberCatastrophic()` send Discord message?

**File:** `backend/src/services/expedition.service.ts` lines 1083-1152
- ‚ùå Line 1132: Only calls `dailyEventLogService.logCharacterCatastrophicReturn()`
- ‚ùå No Discord notification sent
- ‚ùå Event logged but not public

**Fix:** Add Discord channel notification in service or cron

---

### Gap #4: Expedition Status Restrictions Not Enforced in eatFood()

**Spec says:**
```
PLANNING/LOCKED: Si character mange ‚Üí mange dans les stocks de la ville
DEPARTED: Si character mange ‚Üí mange dans les stocks de l'exp√©dition
```

**Current code (line 44-58) handles this correctly BUT:**
- Doesn't prevent eating if LOCKED (treats like PLANNING - correct)
- Doesn't prevent eating if PLANNING (correct - should eat from town)
- Question: Can character eat while LOCKED? Spec doesn't say...

**Current behavior:** Character in LOCKED expedition eats from CITY stock (line 54-58)
**Spec interpretation:** Should be same as PLANNING (not DEPARTED), so this is correct

---

### Gap #5: No Validation on Character State During PLANNING Phase

**Spec says:**
```
Si un member de l'exp√©dition meurt [during PLANNING]
il est automatiquement retir√© de l'exp√©dition
```

**Current code:**
- No mechanism to remove dead members during PLANNING
- Only removes during DEPARTED phase (PA deduction cron)

**Impact:** Dead characters remain in PLANNING expeditions

**Fix:** Add check in `lockExpeditionsDue()` to remove dead members before locking

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUES

### Issue #1: Direction Appending Happens Before PA Deduction

**Current order (daily-pa.cron.ts):**
1. STEP 6: Append daily directions (line 141-176)
2. STEP 7: Deduct PA (line 178-268)

**Concern:** What if character is removed catastrophically?
- Path still updated with today's direction
- Character no longer in expedition
- Path shows direction they never traveled

**Impact:** Minimal (historical record kept)
**Fix:** Could swap order, but not critical

---

### Issue #2: PM Contagion Doesn't Account for Expedition Members

**File:** `backend/src/cron/daily-pm.cron.ts` lines 36-38

**Current logic:**
```typescript
// Check if in DEPARTED expedition
if (existingExpeditions.length > 0) {
  // Spread PM loss to other expedition members only
}
```

**Concern:** Only spreads to expedition members, not city members
**Spec says:** "Find victims in expedition OR city" ‚úì Code does this

---

### Issue #3: Hunger Increase Happens Before PA Update

**Execution order:**
1. `hunger-increase.cron.ts` (00:00) - decreases hunger
2. `daily-pa.cron.ts` (00:00) - regenerates PA with hunger penalty

**Race condition?**
- Both run at same time (00:00:00)
- Order not guaranteed if parallel
- But `daily-pa.cron.ts` calls `updateAllCharactersActionPoints()` which reads hunger AFTER it's updated
- Should be OK since hunger-decrease happens first

---

## üéØ REQUIRED FIXES (PRIORITY ORDER)

### P0 (CRITICAL - Data Integrity)
1. **Fix catastrophic removal condition:** Change `pm <= 2` to `pm <= 0`
2. **Add dead member check to lockExpeditionsDue():** Remove dead members before locking

### P1 (IMPORTANT - Feature Completeness)
1. **Add Discord notification for catastrophic returns:** Send to admin channel
2. **Check character state when PLANNING ‚Üí LOCKED:** Don't lock with bad members

### P2 (NICE TO HAVE - UX)
1. Clean up DEBUG console.log statements in controllers
2. Update legacy logging (foodReturned: 0, townFoodStock: 0)
3. Improve error messages for expedition failures

---

## üîç FILES TO REVIEW/MODIFY

### Must Review:
1. `backend/src/cron/daily-pa.cron.ts` - Fix catastrophic conditions
2. `backend/src/cron/expedition.cron.ts` - Add member checks on lock
3. `backend/src/services/expedition.service.ts` - Add Discord notification

### Should Clean:
1. `backend/src/controllers/expedition.ts` - Remove DEBUG console.log
2. `backend/src/services/expedition.service.ts` - Fix legacy logging

### Already Good:
1. `backend/src/cron/hunger-increase.cron.ts` - Correct
2. `backend/src/cron/daily-pm.cron.ts` - Correct
3. `backend/src/controllers/character/character-stats.controller.ts` - Correct
4. `backend/src/services/expedition.service.ts` (PA deduction) - Correct
5. Discord bot handlers - Mostly correct

---

## üìù NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Preserve existing data:** No schema changes needed
2. **Testing:** Focus on character state transitions
3. **Logging:** Add Discord notifications via dailyEventLogService
4. **Edge cases:** Handle simultaneous lock + catastrophic return conditions
5. **Order of operations:** Ensure character checks happen BEFORE any status change
