# Backend Refactoring - Overview

**Status**: Planning Phase
**Started**: 2025-10-19
**Goal**: Refactor backend to make it clean, maintainable, and follow DRY principles

---

## Quick Navigation

- **This file (00-OVERVIEW.md)**: Project overview and status
- **01-CURRENT-STATE.md**: Detailed analysis of current architecture
- **02-ISSUES-IDENTIFIED.md**: Code smells, duplication, and problems
- **03-TARGET-ARCHITECTURE.md**: Desired architecture and patterns
- **04-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md**: Phased implementation roadmap
- **05-PROGRESS-TRACKER.md**: Real-time progress tracking

---

## Project Goals

### 1. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Eliminate duplicated code patterns
- Extract common utilities and helpers
- Create reusable query builders for Prisma

### 2. Clean Architecture
- Clear separation of concerns (Routes → Controllers → Services → Data Access)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Well-organized directory structure

### 3. Maintainability
- Comprehensive documentation
- Type safety improvements
- Validation layer with schema validators
- Error handling consistency

---

## Current Codebase Stats

- **Total Files**: 64 TypeScript files
- **Total Lines of Code**: ~12,979 LOC
- **Architecture**: Layered MVC with Service Layer
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Framework**: Express.js

### File Distribution

| Layer | Files | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Routes | 14 | HTTP endpoint definitions |
| Controllers | 13 | Request handling and validation |
| Services | 13 | Business logic and transactions |
| Utilities | 6 | Validation, mapping, helpers |
| Middleware | 1 | Authentication and authorization |
| Cron Jobs | 6 | Scheduled background tasks |
| Config | 2 | app.ts, server.ts |

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Code Duplication**: Resource stock queries repeated 10+ times
2. **Include Pattern Repetition**: Character includes duplicated 15+ times
3. **No Schema Validation**: Manual validation scattered across files
4. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Some services use singleton Prisma, others create instances
5. **Large Files**: character.service.ts (1,157 LOC), characters.ts controller (1,023 LOC)

---

## Refactoring Approach

### Phase-Based Implementation
We'll use an incremental approach to avoid breaking changes:

1. **Phase 1**: Documentation and analysis (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Extract utilities and common patterns
3. **Phase 3**: Implement validation layer
4. **Phase 4**: Refactor services for consistency
5. **Phase 5**: Optimize large files
6. **Phase 6**: Testing and verification

### Safety Measures
- Run TypeScript compilation after each change
- Keep detailed progress logs
- Create rollback points
- Test critical functionality

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All duplicated patterns extracted into utilities
- [ ] Validation layer implemented with Zod
- [ ] No file exceeds 500 lines of code
- [ ] All services use consistent patterns
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes
- [ ] Documentation complete and up-to-date

## Documentation Structure

This refactoring is fully documented to allow continuation even if conversation context is lost:

```

├── 00-OVERVIEW.md              (This file - project overview)
├── 01-CURRENT-STATE.md         (Architecture analysis)
├── 02-ISSUES-IDENTIFIED.md     (Problems and code smells)
├── 03-TARGET-ARCHITECTURE.md   (Desired state)

```

## How to Continue This Work

If you're picking up this refactoring after a break:

1. **Read this file first** to understand the project
2. **Check 05-PROGRESS-TRACKER.md** to see what's been done
3. **Review 04-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** to see what's next
4. **Follow the next pending task** in the tracker
5. **Update documentation** as you work
