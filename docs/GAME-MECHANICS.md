## 📊 Character Stats Overview

Each character has four primary stats that govern their survival and actions:

| Stat                     | Range | Icon | Description                             |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| **PA** (Points d'Action) | 0-4   | ⚡   | Action points for performing activities |
| **HP** (Points de Vie)   | 0-5   | ❤️   | Health points                           |
| **PM** (Points Mentaux)  | 0-5   | 💜   | Mental health points                    |
| **Hunger** (Faim)        | 0-4   | 🍖   | Hunger level                            |

## 🍖 Hunger System (Faim)

### Hunger Levels

| Level | Name    | Visual | Effects                        | Daily Update |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **4** | Satiété | 😊     | Heals +1 HP per day            | -1 hunger    |
| **3** | Faim    | 🤤     | Normal state                   | -1 hunger    |
| **2** | Faim    | 😕     | Normal state                   | -1 hunger    |
| **1** | Affamé  | 😰     | Only +1 PA regen instead of +2 | -1 hunger    |
| **0** | Agonie  | 💀     | Sets HP to 1 (Agonie state)    | Stays at 0   |

### Hunger Mechanics

- **Daily Decrease:** Hunger decreases by 1 point every day at midnight
- **Satiété Bonus:** At hunger level 4, characters heal 1 HP per day (before hunger decreases)
- **Affamé Penalty:** At hunger level ≤1, PA regeneration is reduced to +1 instead of +2
- **Starvation:** When hunger reaches 0, the character enters Agonie (HP drops to 1)

### Eating

Characters can eat to restore hunger:

- **Vivres (Food Supplies):** Restores hunger (exact amount varies)
- **Nourriture (Prepared Food):** Restores hunger (exact amount varies)
- **Location Matters:**
  - In city → Uses city stocks
  - In DEPARTED expedition → Uses expedition stocks

## ❤️ Health System (HP - Points de Vie)

### HP Levels

| Level   | State  | Visual     | Effects                        |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **5-2** | Normal | ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ | No restrictions                |
| **1**   | Agonie | ❤️‍🩹🖤🖤🖤🖤 | **Cannot use PA**              |
| **0**   | Mort   | 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 | Character dies (`isDead=true`) |

### HP Mechanics

- **Death Check:** If HP reaches 0, character dies (`isDead=true`) during daily update
- **Agonie State:** At HP=1, character cannot use PA (any action blocked)
- **Healing Options:**
  - **Natural:** Eating at hunger level 4 (Satiété) → +1 HP per day
  - **Cataplasme:** Use a cataplasme (science resource) → +1 HP instantly
- **No Natural Regen:** HP does NOT regenerate on its own except through Satiété or cataplasmes

## 💜 Mental Health System (PM - Points Mentaux)

### PM Levels

| Level   | State      | Visual     | Effects                        |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **5-2** | Normal     | 💜💜💜💜💜 | No restrictions                |
| **1**   | Déprime    | 💜🖤🖤🖤🖤 | **Cannot use PA**              |
| **0**   | Dépression | 💜🖤🖤🖤🖤 | **Cannot use PA + Contagious** |

### PM Mechanics

- **Déprime (PM=1):** Character cannot use PA (all actions blocked)
- **Dépression (PM=0):** Character cannot use PA AND spreads depression to others

#### PM Contagion System

When a character has PM=0 (Dépression):

1. **Daily Spread:** Each day at midnight, they affect ONE random character in their location
2. **Location Rules:**
   - If in city → Affects one random city character (not in DEPARTED expeditions)
   - If in DEPARTED expedition → Affects one random expedition member
3. **Target Selection:**
   - Target must NOT already be depressed (PM > 0)
   - Target must NOT be dead
   - Target must be in the same location
4. **Effect:** The affected character loses 1 PM

**Example:** Alice has PM=0 in the city. Bob and Carol are also in the city with PM=3. During the daily update, ONE of them (randomly selected) will drop to PM=2.

---

## ⚡ Action Points System (PA - Points d'Action)

### PA Mechanics

- **Range:** 0-4 PA
- **Daily Regeneration:** Characters gain PA every day at midnight
  - **Normal:** +2 PA per day
  - **Affamé (Hunger ≤1):** Only +1 PA per day
  - **Maximum:** PA cannot exceed 4

### PA Usage Restrictions

Characters **CANNOT** use PA if:

- **HP ≤ 1** (Agonie or dead)
- **PM ≤ 1** (Déprime or Dépression)

Error messages:

- HP=1: "Vous êtes en agonie et ne pouvez pas utiliser de PA"
- PM≤1: "Votre moral est trop bas pour utiliser des PA"

### PA Usage

PA is consumed when:

- Using capabilities (Hunt, Gather, Fish, etc.)
- Contributing to chantiers (construction projects)
- Other gameplay actions

---

## 🕐 Daily Update System

Every day at **midnight (00:00 Europe/Paris)**, the following updates occur **in order**:

### Execution Order

1. **Heal HP (if Satiété)**

   - If `hungerLevel = 4` AND `hp < 5` → `hp + 1`

2. **Decrease Hunger**

   - All living characters → `hungerLevel - 1`
   - If hunger reaches 0 → Set `hp = 1` (Agonie)

3. **Check Death**

   - If `hp = 0` → Set `isDead = true`

4. **PM Contagion**

   - For each character with `pm = 0`:
     - Find eligible targets in same location
     - Randomly select ONE target
     - Decrease target's PM by 1

5. **PA Regeneration**
   - Calculate PA to add based on hunger:
     - `hungerLevel ≤ 1` → +1 PA
     - `hungerLevel > 1` → +2 PA
   - Add PA (max 4)

## 🛠️ Capabilities System

Characters can perform various activities using their PA (action points). Capabilities are divided into categories:

### 🌾 HARVEST Capabilities

Gather raw resources from the environment:

| Capability        | Cost      | Output                       | Description                               |

| **Miner**         | 2 PA      | 2-6 Minerai                  | Mine ore from rocks                       |

**Pêcher Loot Tables:**

- **1 PA:** 17 possible outcomes (0-4 vivres, 2 bois, 2 minerai)
- **2 PA:** 17 possible outcomes (1-10 vivres, 4-6 bois/minerai) + rare GRIGRI event

### 🔨 CRAFT Capabilities

Transform raw resources into refined goods:

| Capability             | Cost   | Input   | Output     | Formula                  |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |

| **Cuisiner**           | 1-2 PA | Vivres  | Nourriture | Random(Input-1, Input×3) |

**Craft Rules:**

- **1 PA:** Can use max 1 input resource
- **2 PA:** Can use 1-5 input resources
- **Output Formula:** `Output = random(Input - 1, Input × 3)`
  - Example: 5 Bois → 4-15 Tissu
- **Location:** Can only craft in city (not in DEPARTED expeditions)

### 🔬 SCIENCE Capabilities

Special knowledge-based actions:

| Capability        | Cost      | Effect                         | Description                                             |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soigner**       | 1 or 2 PA | Heal +1 HP OR Craft cataplasme | Two modes: heal target (1 PA) or create medicine (2 PA) |
| **Analyser**      | 1 PA      | Admin only                     | Research and analysis (admin capability)                |
| **Cartographier** | 1 PA      | Admin only                     | Map exploration (admin capability)                      |

**Soigner Modes:**

- **Mode 1 (1 PA):** Heal a target character for +1 HP
- **Mode 2 (2 PA):** Craft 1 cataplasme (requires limit check)

### 🩹 Cataplasme System

**Cataplasme** is a special science resource with strict limits:

- **Creation:** Use Soigner capability (2 PA)
- **Limit:** Maximum 3 cataplasmes per town (city + all expeditions combined)
- **Usage:** Use from `/profil` button when HP < 5
- **Effect:** Restores 1 HP instantly
- **Storage:** Appears in `/stock` command under science resources

**Important:** The 3-cataplasme limit is shared across the entire town, not per expedition. This prevents stockpiling.

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

1. **Maintain Satiété (Hunger=4)** to heal HP naturally
2. **Avoid PM=0** to prevent spreading depression to your team
3. **Use PA before daily reset** - They cap at 4 and don't accumulate
4. **Monitor expedition members** - Depression spreads faster in small groups
5. **Return expeditions early** if too many members are depressed or injured
6. **Keep 1-2 cataplasmes in stock** for emergencies (max 3 per town)
7. **Craft in bulk with 2 PA** - More input = more output (up to 5 inputs)
8. **Balance resource gathering** - Fish (1 PA) is cheaper than mining (2 PA)
