‚óè I'll continue investigating the issue with character "Squirrel Never Die" getting
  "Received one or more errors" when accessing /profil.

  Let me search for the checkCharacterStatus function to understand what's causing this
  error:

‚óè Search(pattern: "checkCharacterStatus", type: "ts")
  ‚éø  Found 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè Read(src/services/characters.service.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 185 lines

‚óè Now let me check where this function is called and how errors are handled:

‚óè Search(pattern: "Received one or more errors", type: "ts", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 0 lines 

‚óè The error "Received one or more errors" is likely coming from the HTTP client. Let me
  check the users.handlers.ts file to see how the profile command handles errors:

‚óè Search(pattern: "Impossible de d√©terminer l'√©tat de votre personnage", type: "ts",
        output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 14 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè Now let me search for where this message is used:

‚óè Search(pattern: "CHARACTER_STATUS_UNKNOWN", type: "ts", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 31 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè Now I need to see the full context around line 240 of users.handlers.ts to understand the
  flow:

‚óè Read(src/features/users/users.handlers.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 100 lines

‚óè Let me see the beginning of the handleProfilCommand to understand the full flow:

‚óè Read(src/features/users/users.handlers.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 80 lines

‚óè Read(src/features/users/users.handlers.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 50 lines

‚óè Now let me check the createProfileEmbed function to see if it's throwing an error when
  fetching skills or objects:

‚óè Search(pattern: "async function createProfileEmbed", type: "ts", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 101 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè Read(src/features/users/users.handlers.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 60 lines

‚óè I can see the issue now. The errors from fetching skills and objects are being caught and
  silently ignored (lines 426-429 and 449-452), so they shouldn't be breaking the profile
  display. The error must be happening earlier in the flow.

  Looking at the logs from the summary, the error occurs during checkCharacterStatus. Let me
   check if there's an issue with how the backend returns character data. The error message
  "Received one or more errors" suggests it might be coming from the HTTP client itself when
   calling an endpoint.

  Let me check the docker logs to see what the actual error is:

‚óè Bash(timeout 5 docker compose logs --tail=100 discord-botdev 2>&1 | grep -A 10 -B 10
      "Squirrel\|365228158183800843\|Received one or more errors" || echo "No recent l‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø  discord-botdev  | Cl√© trouv√©e dans CAPABILITIES: FISH           
     discord-botdev  | Emoji trouv√© pour FISH: üé£
     discord-botdev  | getEmojiForCapability - emojiTag re√ßu: HEALING
     ‚Ä¶ +217 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè I can see the character data loads fine. The issue is that the error happens at "Erreur
  lors de la v√©rification du statut du personnage" with "Received one or more errors". This
  is a generic error message that suggests something in the checkCharacterStatus function is
   throwing an error.

  Looking at the code, the error "Received one or more errors" typically comes from axios
  when there's a network or request error. Let me check what specific request might be
  failing in the checkCharacterStatus flow.

  Let me look more carefully at the flow. I see the character loads successfully in the
  admin panel but fails in /profil. Let me check if the issue is in the try/catch block in
  handleProfilCommand:

‚óè Read(src/features/users/users.handlers.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 60 lines

‚óè Now I understand! Looking at the logs more carefully, I can see that:

  1. Character "Squirrel Never Die" has "paUsedToday":62
  2. The skills and objects APIs are working fine (skills returns [], objects returns 21
  objects)
  3. The error "Received one or more errors" happens during checkCharacterStatus

  The error occurs because in checkCharacterStatus function at lines 105-112 in
  characters.service.ts, it tries to get the active character from
  /characters/town/${townId}, but the response is missing the full character details (like
  roles). Let me check if that endpoint returns roles:

‚óè Search(pattern: "getTownCharacters", type: "ts")
  ‚éø  Found 6 files (ctrl+o to expand)
  ‚éø  Session limit reached ‚àô resets 7pm
     /upgrade to increase your usage limit.
  ‚éø  Stop hook error

  Est-ce que tu comprends avec ces informations ce qu'il s'est pass√© ? peux-tu corriger cette erreur
